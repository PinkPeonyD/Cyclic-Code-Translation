# JavaScript → PHP → JavaScript Code Generation

This project demonstrates the process of transforming JavaScript code into PHP code, which then generates the original JavaScript code. The task ensures that the JavaScript logic remains intact across transformations, with no reliance on file system access or external dependencies.

---

## Problem Statement

The objective is to:
1. Write a JavaScript program that generates PHP code.
2. Ensure the PHP code outputs JavaScript that reproduces the original JavaScript logic.
3. Validate that the final JavaScript file matches the initial logic.

**Restrictions:**
- No access to the file system for reading or writing source code.
- No use of APIs to retrieve the executing script.
- Everything must be done in a single file for each language.

## Files

- **`solution.js`**: The initial JavaScript file that generates PHP code.
- **`solution.php`**: PHP code generated by `solution.js`, which outputs JavaScript.
- **`solution2.js`**: JavaScript code generated by `solution.php`.

---

## Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Generate PHP Code from JavaScript
Run the following command to execute `solution.js` and generate `solution.php`:

node solution.js > solution.php

### Step 2: Generate JavaScript Code from PHP
Run the PHP script to generate solution2.js:

php solution.php > solution2.js

### Step 3: Execute the Final JavaScript Code
Run the final JavaScript code to verify its functionality:

node solution2.js
